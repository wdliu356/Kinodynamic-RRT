# Kinodynamic-RRT-Path-Planning
## Introduction
This a course project for personal use. For visualization and pybullet, I refered to https://github.com/yanglunlai/Kinodynamic-RRT-Path-Planning. Other sections are rewritten thoroughly.
The first figure shows the result with 9 motion options like a car.

The second figure shows the case that enables the lattitude control

The third figure show the case that enables all combination of motions
![Alt text](18_path.png?raw=true "25 motion case")
